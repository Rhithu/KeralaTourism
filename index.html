                  <p>Kerala (English: /ˈkɛrələ/ KERR-ə-lə; Malayalam: ke:ɾɐɭɐm (About this soundlisten)) is a state on the Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on  November , following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore. Spread over , km (, sq mi), Kerala is the twenty-first largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With  million inhabitants as per the  census, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into  districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state.

                   The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since  BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around  CE. In the th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in . The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, , the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Lakshadweep Islands, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara (Tulunad), and the erstwhile state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, and Shenkottai taluks).
